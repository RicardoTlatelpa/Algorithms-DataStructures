'''
Ninjaland is a country in the shape of a 2-dimensional grid 'GRID', with 'N' rows and 'M' columns. Each point in the grid has some cost associated with it. 
Find a path from top left i.e. (0,0) to the bottom right i.e. {'N'-1, 'M'-1} which minimizes the sum of the cost of the all the numbers along the path. You need to tell the minimum sum of that path.
