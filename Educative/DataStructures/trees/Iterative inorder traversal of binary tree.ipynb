    "# Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a binary tree, write an iterative algorithm for the in order traversal of a binary tree. The algorithm should print out the value of each node such that it conforms to the in-order travesal of the input binary tree. The function is not expected to return a value, only to print it out on the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution \n",
    "\n",
    "The in-order traversal of a binary tree starts from the root. As we traverse the binary tree in-order iteratively, a stack is helpful to track the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a BST, our in-order traversal solution prints nodes in sorted ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "To traverse the tree-in-order, we first visit the left node \"L\" followed by the current node \"N\", and finally the right node \"R\". We repeat this process for every node during the traversal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we print out node in the 'L N R' sequence, where the current node \"N\" comes in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are we the steps you need to folow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We must initailize a stack data structure and point the current node pointer to the root.\n",
    "2. Now, push the current node onto the stack and point the current node to its left child.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 until the current node points to a null value.\n",
    "4. If the current node is nuill and the stack is not empty, perform the following operations:\n",
    "    - Print the top stack element\n",
    "    - pop the top stack element and point the current node to the right child of the popped element\n",
    "5. If the current node is null and the stack is empty, we terminate our algorithm. let's run the above algorithm on a sample tree.\n",
