    "The time complexity of creating the iterator is linear O(N). The iterator method hasNext() has a time complexity of O(1), whereas the cumulative time complexity of calling getNext() till we traverse the whole tree is O(N).\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity of this iterative solution is O(H) because our algorithm uses a stack that stores data up to the height of the binary tree, h. The complexity will be O(logN) for a balanced tree and O(N) for a degenerate tree.\n",

    "# Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Soaking up the algorithm a little more I'm realizing that the pattern of this algorithm is very linear with some jumps here and there, the jump from left to right is what I'm referring to. The first iterator of a binary tree of height h is a great example of this (assuming the tree is balanced), we populate the stack with just left values, if viewed in a diagram, that iteration is linear, as elements pop off the stack, we make jumps from the left child to the right child if it exists, again at that right child position(referred to as a root in the populateIterator parameter) we again do a linear traversal of only left nodes and append these nodes to the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "since we're already at the end of the binary tree(all the way to the left), there isn't much traversal(populate iteration) to be done if we run into a right child that belongs to a popped off left node in the stack. It is until we get to the real root of the binary tree where the right child holds h left nodes(assuming again a balanced tree) and the same steps will follow, the linearly left child path will be added to the stack, and then jumps to right children, that don't have many left nodes because we always end up at the end of the binary tree when we get close to the root of the node, or when we first populate the stack with all the left children of the binary tree."
