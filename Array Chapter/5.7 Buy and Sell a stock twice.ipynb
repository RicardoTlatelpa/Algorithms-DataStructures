    "The ineffiency in the above approaches comes from not taking advantage of previous computations. Suppose we record the best solution for A[0,j] j between 1 and n-1 inclusive. Now we can do a reverse iteration, computing the best solution for a single buy and sell for A[j,n-1], j between 1 and n-1, inclusive. For each day, we combine this result with the result from the foward iteration "
