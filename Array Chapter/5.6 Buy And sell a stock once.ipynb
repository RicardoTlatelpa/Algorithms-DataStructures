    "# 5.6 Buy and Sell a Stock once\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is concerned with the problem of optimally buying and selling a stock once, as described on Page 2. As an example, consider the following sequence of stock prices: \n",
    "(310, 315, 275, 295, 260, 270, 290, 230, 255, 250)\n",
    "The maximum profit that can be made with one buy and one sell is 30, buy at 260 and sell at 290. Note that 260 is not the lowest price, nor 290 the highest price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that takes an array denoting the daily stock price, and returns the maximum profit that could be made by buying and then selling one share of that stock. There is no need to buy if no profit is possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: identifying the minimum and maximum is not enough since the minimum may appear after the maximum height. Focus on valid differences."
