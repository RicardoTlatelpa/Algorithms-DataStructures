'''
Implement a queue API using an array for storing elements. Your API should 
include a constructor function, which takes as argument the initial capacity
of the queue, enqueue, and dequeue functions, and a function which returns
the number of elements stored. Implement dynamic resizing to support storing 
an arbitrarily large number of elements.
