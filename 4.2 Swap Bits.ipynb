    "- On the first line of the function, checking if they differ\n",
    " - instead of iterating the number we shift the number so that the digit we want is the least significant bit. We can only extract the LSB if we perform an AND operation. From there we retain the digit we want at a certain index starting from the LSB. We don't start the shift from zero. Actually we don't start from zero at all because we are not iterating we are **shifting**."
