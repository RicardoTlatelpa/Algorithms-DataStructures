    "# Time and space complexity of the pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this code is O(N) and the space complexity is O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "the time complexity is O(N) because there are 2 for loops and one of them iterates through the array once and the other for loop iterates the list N/2 times\n",
    "\n",
    "so the big O becomes O(N + N/2), combining like terms we get 3N/2, however since N is the biggest number as N goes to infinity, the big O simplifies to O(N) \n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is O(1) because all of them space operations in the function are constants and constants boil down to O(1)"
