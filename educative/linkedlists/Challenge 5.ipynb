    "# Challenge 5: Reverse a linked List \n",
    "\n",
    "You have to defined the reverse function, which takes a singly linked list and produces the exact opposite list, the links of the output linked list should be reversed.\n",

    "1 -> 2 -> None\n",
    "prev = None, next = 2, current = 1 \n",

    "1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None\n",
    "1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> None\n",
    "\n",
    "How to keep reverse going when we're keeping track of 2 bits at a time \n",
    "If we have access to a previous node and a next node and the current node, 3 nodes at a time\n",
    "and only the current node can tell if the next next node will be None, or the \"next\" node next node can tell\n",
    "when the list ends, how can we reverse all the elements?\n",

    "@ node 5 we can tell that the next next node is None\n",
    "also @ node 5 we can tell that the next node 6 is None\n",
    "we also have access to the previous node 4 \n",
    "\n",
    "so we can tell 5 to be the next node's next node like this 6 -> 5\n",
    "and the previous node pointer 4 to be 5's next node, 6 -> 5 -> 4 \n",
    "\n",

    "But the way to think of every iteration is what surprised me. Every node is thought of the potential head of the final reversed linked list \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "and this pattern is seen when we delete nodes from a linked list, they are isolated as they are removed, the node that gets deleted has no next pointer and no node points to the deleted node, leaving the node out of the linked list\n",
