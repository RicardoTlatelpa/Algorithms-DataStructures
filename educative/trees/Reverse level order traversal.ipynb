    "Here is what our algorithm will look like; only the highlighed lines have changed. Please note that, for Java, we will use a linked list instead of an array list for our result list. As in the case of arraylist, appending an element at the beginning means shifting all the existing elements. Since we need to append the level array at the beginning of the result list, a linked list will be better, as this shifting of elements is not required in a linked list. Similarly, we use a double ended queue(deque) for Python, C++, and javascript.\n"
