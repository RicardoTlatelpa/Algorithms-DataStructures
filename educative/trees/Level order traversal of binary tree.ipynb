    "For this problem we have to use a queue instead of a stack because we're going to need the first elements to be the first elements out\n",

    "the issue was, there was not a simple way to distinguish children from parents if we're just appending to the queue, so I added a layer of complexity and distinguishness by using nested queues, once the nested queue were empty, that meant, the parent nodes can be divided in the list\n",
