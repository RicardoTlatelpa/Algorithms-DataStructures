    "# Queue vs Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into what I wrote, the first question we have to ask ourselves\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a stack a queue, if both had similar datastutures, what makes one different than the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure we are using is a stack, which is built on top of a list\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 main functionalities are pushing and popping\n",
    "pushing is a very simple operation, it's simply taking a value and appending it into a list\n",
    "\n",
    "the popping method is also very simply, it is removing the last element of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "so whatever comes in first goes out last \n",
    "\n",
    "The queue has 2 main functionalities, enqueuing and dequeuing\n",
    "\n",
    "Enqueue is a fancy way to say append to the queue, items are appended to a queue the same way the stack appends\n",
    "them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "however the dequeue method is what separates both data structures, because the queue removes the last item that was enqueued into the queue, so first in first out\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to build a queue with a stack, we would have add into the stack differently and remove from the stack differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Although my code passed the test cases I did not use the correct functionalities to accomplish the goal, I used loops and swapping techniques, and didn't really take advantage of the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "So the code is **Wrong**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Thought process\n",
    "\n",
    "say we have a list [1,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "What would happen if I removed something from this list, if this list was a stack\n",
    "\n",
    "[1,2,3] -> [1,2] (3 was removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what would happen if this was a queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "[1,2,3] -> [2,3] (1 was removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is clear, but the problem is, how can we implement enqueue() and dequeue() functions using only stack methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Well we can take advantage of the fact that we can use multiple stacks, for such a task\n",
    "\n",
    "let's say we want to dequeue from list [1,2,3] and the list has only stack methods, well we want to remove 1\n",
    "\n",
    "that means we're removing one element from the list and it's at the 0th index of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "we have a method called size we can take advantage of, so the size is 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "we can iterate size - 1 times and pop off the stack elements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original stack popping off size - 1 times**\n",
    "[1,2,3]\n",
    "[1,2] 3\n",
    "[1] 2\n",
    "\n",
    "and we can push 3,2 into a temporary stack\n",
    "\n",
    "deleted_element = original_stack.pop() = 1\n",
    "**Original stack**\n",
    "[]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporary stack**\n",
    "[3,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "then we pop off the this stack until it is empty and push each item back into the original stack\n",
    "[3,2] 2 \n",
    "[3] 3\n",

    "**Original stack after dequeue**\n",
    "[2,3]\n",
