    "This problem is concerned with deleting repeated elements from a sorted array. For example, for the array (2,3,5,5,7,11,11,11,13) then after deletiion, the array (2,3,5,7,11,13,0,0,0). After deleting repeated elements, there are 6 valid entries. There are no requirements as to the values stored beyond the last valid element.\n",
